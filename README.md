# Page Fragments
A collection of Page Fragments for Liferay DXP.

These Fragments were developed using the [Fragment Editor](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029046471-Developing-Fragments), and then exported to ZIP file.

You can either download the source files and create yourself, or download the exported ZIP file and import into your own environment.
